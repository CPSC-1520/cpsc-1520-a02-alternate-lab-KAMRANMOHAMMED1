## Overall Impression

The tutorial did a great job breaking down the concept of functions. It explained function declarations, calling functions, and passing arguments in a straightforward way. The examples made it clear how functions can help organize code and avoid repetition, which is an essential habit in programming.

Could briefly introduce arrow functions for modern JavaScript, even if it's just a teaser for later.

## Rating

8 / 10

A very clear and effective introduction to functions. Great for beginners, and with just a touch more depth (like return vs. log, or a mini practice task), it could really shine.
