## Overall Impression
This tutorial was a solid introduction to JavaScript string methods. It covered essential operations like concatenation, finding string length, using substring(), toUpperCase(), toLowerCase(), and indexOf() — all of which are extremely useful. The examples were simple and easy to follow, especially for someone just getting comfortable with JavaScript.


----

## Errors/Typos

In one of the examples, a semicolon was missing at the end of the line — not a big deal, but worth correcting for consistency.

Would be clearer if substring() examples explicitly mentioned the zero-based index behavior and how the second argument is exclusive.



----

## Improvements
Adding a table summarizing the string methods used (e.g. method name, what it does, and an example) would make for a great quick reference.

## Rating
8.5 / 10

Clean, direct, and very beginner-friendly. Would benefit from a small hands-on practice or mini challenge, but otherwise a strong tutorial on string basics.
