## Overall Impression

The tutorial provided a solid introduction to JavaScript. It covered the fundamentals such as variables, data types, functions, conditionals, and loops in a simple and approachable way. The examples were helpful, and the explanations were easy to follow, especially for someone with little or no prior coding experience.



----

## Errors/Typos

I didn’t encounter any major typos or broken code, but a couple of notes:

The prompt() function may not work as expected in all browsers due to security settings.

A minor comment in the loop example said it would run 10 times, but the loop only ran 9 iterations

----

## Improvements

Adding small exercises or quizzes after each section would help reinforce the material.

A short summary or checklist at the end to recap all concepts covered would be helpful.

A few interactive challenges or links to practice platforms would be a great bonus.

## Rating
8 / 10

It’s a strong introduction for beginners. With a few interactive additions or practice tasks, it could become even more engaging.
