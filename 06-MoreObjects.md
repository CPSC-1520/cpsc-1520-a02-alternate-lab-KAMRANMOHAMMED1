## Overall Impression
This tutorial was a great follow-up to the previous lesson on complex data types. It helped reinforce how objects work, especially when dealing with nested objects, arrays of objects, and accessing data dynamically. The examples felt more real-world and practical, making it easier to imagine how this applies to things like user profiles, products, or settings.


----

## Errors/Typos
None Found


----

## Improvements
Maybe include a mini example of adding or deleting properties dynamically using delete or bracket notation.

## Rating
8.5 / 10

A strong tutorial that builds nicely on earlier lessons. Just needs a few clarifying notes and a bit more interactivity to feel more complete.
