## Overall Impression
This tutorial was a great introduction to complex data types in JavaScript, especially arrays and objects. The breakdown of syntax and usage for both was clear, and the real-world examples (like accessing object properties and looping through arrays) made the concepts easier to grasp. It was especially helpful how the tutorial emphasized the structure of an object and how to work with key-value pairs.


----

## Errors/Typos

One small typo: in the object section, a missing comma between properties could lead to confusion or an error in actual code.

----

## Improvements

Could include a visual diagram showing how objects and arrays are structured in memory or how they nest inside each other.

## Rating

9 / 10

This tutorial was informative and did a great job introducing arrays and objects. The content was beginner-friendly and practical, and with a couple of small interactive additions, it would be perfect.
